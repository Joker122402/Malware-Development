# First Implant

This is my first implant and my first custom malware dropper. Its written in C++ and employs Function Call Obfuscation, and AES Encryption to evade AV. 

90% Of function calls are obfuscated aside from 1 or 2 (such as GetProcAddress that ic ant wrap my head around at the moment).
All strings and function names are encrypted. Every encrypted string/name has it own encryption key as well. 

I have also randomized custom function names as well as the word "payload" to break common AV signatures. 
Eventually I will randomize the names of every encrypted string as well to make the implant harder to reverse engineer.
Being that it will be harder to understand the code the more i randomize things, there is an included file called Key.txt which conatins a list of randomized strings and what they correspond to.

All the files needed to compile the implant are present. The payload i sued during testing was an x64 staged meterpreter payload. If you wish to change it, replace meterp_x64.bin with a raw binary file containing your payload.
Once you create a payload, you need to encrypt it. There are plenty of scripts you can find online to do this. The encrypted payload should be stored in a file called "favicon.ico".

Once you have your encrypted payload you can compile the implant. You will need VS BuildTools to do this (you have them if you have Visual Studio Installed):
```
rc resources.rc
cvtres /MACHINE:x64 /OUT:resources.o resources.res
cl.exe /nologo /Ox /MT /W0 /GS- /DNDEBUG /Tcimplant.cpp /link /OUT:implant.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /MACHINE:x64 resources.o
```
